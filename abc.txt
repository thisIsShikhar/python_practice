Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme
importance of Porlock. Led on by some rudi-
mentary aspirations towards right, and encour-
aged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional
ten-pound note sent to him by devious meth-
ods, he has once or twice given me advance in-
formation which has been of valueâ€”that highest
value which anticipates and prevents rather than
avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the
cipher, we should find that this communication is
of the nature that I indicate.
